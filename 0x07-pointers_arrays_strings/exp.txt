0-memset.c;-
- _memset takes three params s, b, n
- iterate over the memory area pointed to by s using a pointer ptr
- while n > 0 
- set the value at current memory location pointed to by ptr to the constant byte b
- increment ptr to point to the next mem location
- decrement n to track the number of remaining bytes
