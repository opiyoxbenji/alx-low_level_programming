0-memset.c;-
- _memset takes three params s, b, n
- iterate over the memory area pointed to by s using a pointer ptr
- while n > 0 
- set the value at current memory location pointed to by ptr to the constant byte b
- increment ptr to point to the next mem location
- decrement n to track the number of remaining bytes
- returns s

1-memcpy;-
- _memcpy takes three params dest, src, n
- integer x is declared and assigned to the value of n
- integer i is declared
- If the condition in the if statement is true, the for loop is entered. The loop initializes i to 0 and continues as long as i is less than a. The loop increments i by 1 in each iteration.
Inside the loop, the byte at index i in the source memory area (src) is assigned to the byte at the corresponding index i in the destination memory area (dest). This copies the byte from the source memory area to the destination memory area.
Once the loop finishes, all the specified bytes have been copied from the source to the destination memory area.
Finally, the function returns the pointer to the destination memory area
